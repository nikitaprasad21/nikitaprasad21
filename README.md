#### At this moment, I want to draw your focus to my endeavors as a Data Analyst outlined below:

* In my most recent role at Collegedunia Web Private Limited, I worked on implementing NLP Models to clean and classify raw text data, as well as performing keyword extraction and building similar articles pipeline. 
Additionally, I fetched data of geopolitical and person entities from multiple work industries and created master lists for tagging news articles using Web Scrapping Techniques. I also utilized Language Detection and Translation Models to work with news articles in different languages. 
These experiences had honed my problem-solving and critical thinking skills, and have allowed me to work effectively in a team environment.

* In my recent project on Product Recommendation Analysis, I designed a SQL-based superstore data warehouse and analyzed trends of 10K customer records to identify profitable market segments. 
Using Python NLP model, I built Popularity And Collaborative Recommendation Systems to suggest the right items based on user interests. 
Moreover, I designed a Quarterly Sales Forecasting Dashboard to get insights on state-wise distribution of sales and profit time series using Tableau. 
This project have taught me how to work independently and navigate ambiguous tasks to find suitable solutions.

* In my previous project on Predicting Credit Card Customers Segmentation, I performed attrition analysis for 25K credit card users using SQL and developed customer churning analysis visualizations to identify and predict hidden patterns and trends from records using Tableau. 
Furthermore, I deployed supervised ML models to improve retention rate with accuracy of 75.28% on test data for Random Forest Classifier (RFC). 
These experiences have allowed me to develop my critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which I believe would be valuable in solving real-life problems.

As an analyst I am eager to gain a deeper understanding of the data lifecycle with a range of tools and techniques, distilling down data for actionable takeaways and making recommendations across different business groups. 
If my experience intrigues you and you believe I could be a valuable addition to your team,
